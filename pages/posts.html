            <h3>Muons:'Strong' evidence found for a new force of nature</h3>
            <div class="author pull-right">
              <b>Author:</b> <em>Pallab Ghosh</em> | <i>Friday 04/16/2021</i>
            </div>
            <p>
              From sticking a magnet on a fridge door to throwing a ball into a
              basketball hoop, the forces of physics are at play in every moment
              of our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of the forces we experience every day can be reduced to just
              four categories: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong force and
              the weak force. Now, physicists say they have found possible signs
              of a fifth fundamental force of nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, physicists say they have found possible signs of a fifth
              fundamental force of nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              The findings come from research carried out at a laboratory near
              Chicago. The four fundamental forces govern how all the objects
              and particles in the Universe interact with each other. For
              example, gravity makes objects fall to the ground, and heavy
              objects behave as if they are glued to the floor. The UK's Science
              and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) said the result "provides
              strong evidence for the existence of an undiscovered sub-atomic
              particle or new force". But the results from the Muon g-2
              experiment don't add up to a conclusive discovery yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is currently a one in a 40,000 chance that the result could
              be a statistical fluke - equating to a statistical level of
              confidence described as 4.1 sigma. A level of 5 sigma, or a one in
              3.5 million chance of the observation being a coincidence, is
              needed to claim a discovery.
            </p>

            <h3>Nasa's Ingenuity Mars helicopter set for first flight</h3>
            <div class="author pull-right">
              <b>Author:</b> <em>Rebecca Morelle</em> | <i>Friday 04/16/2021</i>
            </div>
            <p>
              Nasa is set to make history as it attempts to launch a helicopter
              from the surface of Mars.
            </p>
            <p>
              If successful, it would be the first powered, controlled flight on
              another planet. The demonstration should see the Mars-copter -
              called Ingenuity - rise to about 3m, hover for roughly 30 seconds,
              swivel and then land.
            </p>
            <p>
              But with never-tried-before technology and challenging flying
              conditions, the flight will be difficult to pull off. "It feels
              absolutely nuts,” says Farah Alibay, a systems engineer at Nasa’s
              Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
            </p>
            <p>
              "We've been flying on Earth for just over 100 years, and now we're
              like, 'yeah, we're gonna go to another planet and fly'. It's
              crazy. But that's the beauty of exploration. That's the beauty of
              engineering.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Ingenuity is scheduled for lift-off at 07:30 GMT (08:30 BST) on
              Monday. The first data revealing whether the chopper experiment
              worked should start arriving back at Earth some three hours later.

            <h3>Nasa chooses SpaceX to build Moon lander</h3>
            <div class="author pull-right">
              <b>Author:</b> <em>Paul Rincon</em> | <i>Friday 04/16/2021</i>
            </div>
            <p>
              Nasa has chosen Elon Musk's company SpaceX to build a lander that
              will return humans to the Moon this decade. This vehicle will
              carry the next man and the first woman down to the lunar surface
              under the space agency's Artemis programme. Another goal of the
              programme will be to land the first person of colour on the Moon.
            </p>
            <p>
              The lander is based on SpaceX's Starship craft, which is being
              tested at a site in southern Texas. SpaceX was competing against a
              joint bid from traditional aerospace giants and Amazon founder
              Jeff Bezos, as well as Alabama-based Dynetics. The total value of
              the contract awarded to Musk's company is $2.89bn.
            </p>
            <p>
              "With this award, Nasa and our partners will complete the first
              crewed demonstration mission to the surface of the Moon in the
              21st century as the agency takes a step forward for women's
              equality and long-term deep space exploration," said Kathy
              Lueders, the organisation's head of human exploration.
