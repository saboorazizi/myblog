              <h3>'Strong' evidence found for a new force of nature</h3>
              <div class="author pull-right">

              <p>
                From sticking a magnet on a fridge door to throwing a ball into
                a basketball hoop, the forces of physics are at play in every
                moment of our lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                All of the forces we experience every day can be reduced to just
                four categories: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong force and
                the weak force. Now, physicists say they have found possible
                signs of a fifth fundamental force of nature.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, physicists say they have found possible signs of a fifth
                fundamental force of nature.
              </p>
              <p>
                The findings come from research carried out at a laboratory near
                Chicago. The four fundamental forces govern how all the objects
                and particles in the Universe interact with each other. For
                example, gravity makes objects fall to the ground, and heavy
                objects behave as if they are glued to the floor. The UK's
                Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) said the result
                "provides strong evidence for the existence of an undiscovered
                sub-atomic particle or new force". But the results from the Muon
                g-2 experiment don't add up to a conclusive discovery yet.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is currently a one in a 40,000 chance that the result
                could be a statistical fluke - equating to a statistical level
                of confidence described as 4.1 sigma. A level of 5 sigma, or a
                one in 3.5 million chance of the observation being a
                coincidence, is needed to claim a discovery.

              <h3>Nasa's Ingenuity Mars helicopter set for first flight</h3>
              <div class="author pull-right">
                <b>Author:</b> <em>Rebecca Morelle</em> |
                <i>Friday 04/16/2021</i>
              </div>
              <p>
                Nasa is set to make history as it attempts to launch a
                helicopter from the surface of Mars.
              </p>
              <p>
                If successful, it would be the first powered, controlled flight
                on another planet. The demonstration should see the Mars-copter
                - called Ingenuity - rise to about 3m, hover for roughly 30
                seconds, swivel and then land.
              </p>
              <p>
                But with never-tried-before technology and challenging flying
                conditions, the flight will be difficult to pull off. "It feels
                absolutely nuts,” says Farah Alibay, a systems engineer at
                Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
              </p>
              <p>
                "We've been flying on Earth for just over 100 years, and now
                we're like, 'yeah, we're gonna go to another planet and fly'.
                It's crazy. But that's the beauty of exploration. That's the
                beauty of engineering.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Ingenuity is scheduled for lift-off at 07:30 GMT (08:30 BST) on
                Monday. The first data revealing whether the chopper experiment
                worked should start arriving back at Earth some three hours
                later.

              <h3>Nasa chooses SpaceX to build Moon lander</h3>
              <div class="author pull-right">
                <b>Author:</b> <em>Paul Rincon</em> | <i>Friday 04/16/2021</i>
              </div>
              <p>
                Nasa has chosen Elon Musk's company SpaceX to build a lander
                that will return humans to the Moon this decade. This vehicle
                will carry the next man and the first woman down to the lunar
                surface under the space agency's Artemis programme. Another goal
                of the programme will be to land the first person of colour on
                the Moon.
              </p>
              <p>
                The lander is based on SpaceX's Starship craft, which is being
                tested at a site in southern Texas. SpaceX was competing against
                a joint bid from traditional aerospace giants and Amazon founder
                Jeff Bezos, as well as Alabama-based Dynetics. The total value
                of the contract awarded to Musk's company is $2.89bn.
              </p>
              <p>
                "With this award, Nasa and our partners will complete the first
                crewed demonstration mission to the surface of the Moon in the
                21st century as the agency takes a step forward for women's
                equality and long-term deep space exploration," said Kathy
                Lueders, the organisation's head of human exploration.
